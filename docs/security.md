# Security and Privacy

## Implementation status

The sections below are the required security baseline. They are not a statement
that every control is already present. Implemented local controls include signed
WhatsApp webhook verification, hashed/expiring/single-use OTP records, revocable
JWT sessions, application RBAC checks, authenticated field encryption, deep
non-mutating structured/text redaction, explicit Postgres RLS policy DDL, and
non-root application images. A local non-owner/non-bypass Postgres probe,
production-off demo build default and local image vulnerability scans have also been
verified. Still pending are CSRF protection, IP/Redis rate limits, credential key
rotation, raw-access reason gates, export expiry and final exact-registry scan
evidence for the hardened release. Consult the verification ledger before relying
on a control.

The pre-integration production baseline uses explicit `disabled` provider modes and
does not start worker/scheduler. That is a containment state, not a security signoff
for provider integrations. A local mock response in production, an enabled provider
without its contract/canary gate, or a running production idle-shell worker is a
release-blocking configuration defect.

## Assets and threats

High-value assets are provider credentials, customer/order PII, raw chat, tenant
business metrics, research datasets, session/OTP material and backups. Principal
threats are cross-tenant access, broken role checks, webhook forgery/replay, prompt
injection into tools, credential leakage, export exfiltration, queue replay, SSRF
through connectors and compromised dependencies/images.

## Required controls

### Authentication and sessions

- OTPs are randomly generated, hashed with a dedicated secret, short-lived,
  single-use and protected by phone/IP attempt limits.
- The deterministic OTP and log sink exist only when `APP_ENV` is `local` or `test`.
- Browser sessions use `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, appropriate `SameSite` cookies, CSRF
  protection on mutations, rotation after authentication and server-side revocation.
- Authentication responses avoid account enumeration and all login events are
  correlated without logging the raw phone number or OTP.

### Tenant and role isolation

- Application authorization and Postgres RLS both enforce tenant scope.
- Tests use a non-owner database role and attempt ID, query, host and filter tampering.
- Researcher data is pseudonymized/redacted by default. Raw access is time-bound,
  reason-gated and audit logged.
- Admin mutation and audit record commit atomically.

### Provider and agent safety

- Meta webhook bodies are verified against `X-Hub-Signature-256` before parsing.
- Meta message IDs and job idempotency keys prevent duplicate processing.
- External clients have bounded timeouts, response-size limits, retry policy and
  allowlisted base URLs. MCP never accepts arbitrary production URLs.
- Tool execution reconstructs tenant scope server-side; model-provided tenant IDs,
  URLs, credentials and authorization claims are ignored.
- Secrets and raw PII never enter prompts or tool telemetry.

### Secrets

`.env.production` exists only on the host with mode `0600`. Repository and CI scans
cover full history. Tenant credentials are encrypted with a versioned envelope so
key rotation can decrypt with the old key and re-encrypt with the new key. Logs must
redact authorization headers, cookie values, phone numbers, addresses and raw
provider payloads.

The versioned rotation workflow in the previous paragraph is a required target; the
current field cipher does not yet supply complete key-version migration evidence.
The future Anthropic key is owned by the Hermes runtime boundary only. It must not
be passed through the shared Compose application environment or stored per tenant.

### Containers and network

The rendered Compose contract publishes only Caddy ports and keeps database/cache
networks internal. Application Dockerfiles use non-root users; the hardened Caddy
runtime uses fixed UID/GID `10001`, a read-only root filesystem and only
`NET_BIND_SERVICE`. Backup runs as UID/GID 70 with a narrow capability set; the
separate destructive restore profile adds `DAC_OVERRIDE` and is never a standing
service. Production enables `no-new-privileges`, and exact image references are
required. The release workflow publishes commit-SHA-tagged images with provenance
and SBOM, then scans each exact registry digest. The prior baseline API/web images
were published, and all five candidate runtimes have local scan gates; final
five-image publication and exact-registry scan evidence remain pending.

## Research governance

The target governance contract gates research collection by recorded consent,
retains consent version/timestamp/policy version, stops new classification after
withdrawal and initiates a documented retention/deletion workflow without silently
corrupting operational records. The current local flow gates its research message
event and stores consent history, but the deletion workflow, separate retention
schedules, export expiry and download reauthorization are not implemented.

## Verification

Security is evidenced by executable negative tests, not configuration screenshots.
Critical branches—authorization, RLS, signature verification, dedupe, encryption,
redaction and export permissions—target complete branch coverage. See
`docs/verification.md` for claim status and evidence locations.
